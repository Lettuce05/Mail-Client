# Mail-Client
This is a simple CLI python mail client. It is very simple and far from perfect so feel free to clone the project and add extra features to it. Currently it asks for login information, recipient email, the email subject and body, and if you want to add an attachment. Optionally depending on your use case, you could hard code all of these, but I wanted the little program to be more versatile and "plug-n-play".

NOTE: Make sure that the email you are sending with allows for less secure apps

NOTE: Uses Google's SMTP server

### Todo:

- [ ] Add a GUI using tkinter
- [ ] Add Google Authentication
- [ ] Add a browse for file feature
- [ ] Attach multiple files
- [ ] Add a drag and drop feature
- [ ] Send emails to multiple recipients
